# Discord Bot Management Scripts

This directory contains management tooling for the Discord bot project, focused on enforcing consistency and tracking progress across the 5-phase Strategic Product Analysis & Implementation Roadmap.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Management System

### Core Philosophy

The management system strikes a balance between structure and simplicity:

- **Enforces consistency** through phase gating and validation
- **Tracks detailed progress** within each phase
- **Validates completion criteria** automatically where possible
- **Generates meaningful reports** for stakeholders
- **Uses simple, maintainable tools** without over-engineering

### Architecture

```
scripts/
├── bot-health/           # Functional health monitoring
├── roadmap/             # Progress tracking and validation
└── validation/          # (Future: specialized validators)

config/
└── roadmap-config.json  # Phase definitions and criteria

data/
└── roadmap-progress.json # Progress tracking data
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### Bot Health Monitoring

```bash
# Check bot functionality and performance
npm run bot-health
```

### Roadmap Progress Tracking

```bash
# Show current progress status
npm run roadmap-status

# Generate detailed progress report (console/json/markdown)
npm run roadmap-report

# Start a new phase (with dependency validation)
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js start-phase phase-1-foundation

# Complete a phase (with validation)
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js complete-phase phase-1-foundation

# Add tasks to a phase
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js add-task phase-1-foundation arch-review "Complete architecture review"

# Update task status
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js update-task phase-1-foundation arch-review completed
```

### Phase Validation & Gating

```bash
# Run comprehensive roadmap health check
npm run roadmap-health

# Validate phase start prerequisites
npm run validate-phase validate-start phase-2-point-system

# Validate phase completion criteria
npm run validate-phase validate-completion phase-1-foundation

# Enforce phase gating (throws error on failure)
npm run validate-phase enforce-start phase-2-point-system
```

### GitHub Integration

```bash
# Sync roadmap with GitHub issues and branches
npm run roadmap-sync

# Create GitHub issues for a phase
node scripts/roadmap/github-sync.js create-issues phase-1-foundation

# Update GitHub with progress
node scripts/roadmap/github-sync.js sync-progress

# Generate status report
node scripts/roadmap/github-sync.js status
```

## 🔒 Phase Gating System

The system enforces strict phase dependencies:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Audit** - No dependencies (can start immediately)
2. **Phase 2: Point System** - Blocked until Phase 1 is completed and validated
3. **Phase 3: Commands** - Blocked until Phase 2 is completed
4. **Phase 4: Infrastructure** - Blocked until Phase 3 is completed
5. **Phase 5: Integration** - Blocked until Phase 4 is completed

### Validation Criteria

Each phase has:

- **Task completion** requirements
- **Automated validation** tests (linting, testing, performance)
- **Deliverable** validation
- **Success criteria** that must be met

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Task Management

Tasks within each phase are tracked with:

- Status (not-started, in-progress, completed, blocked)
- Priority levels
- Due dates
- Assignees
- Blockers and notes

### Progress Calculation

- **Phase progress** = (completed tasks / total tasks) × 100
- **Overall progress** = average of all phase progress percentages
- **Completion validation** ensures all criteria met before phase completion

## 🔍 Validation Framework

### Automated Validators

- **Command validators**: Run shell commands and check output patterns
- **File existence validators**: Verify required files/documentation exist
- **Test suite validators**: Run specific test suites and check results

### Global Validators

Run across all phases:

- Code quality (ESLint)
- Security audit (npm audit)
- Bot functionality (health check)

## 📈 Reporting

### Available Formats

- **Console**: Real-time status with emoji indicators
- **JSON**: Machine-readable for integration
- **Markdown**: Documentation-friendly format

### Report Content

- Overall progress summary
- Phase-by-phase status
- Task completion metrics
- Active blockers and warnings
- Actionable recommendations

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Starting Phase 1

```bash
# Check if ready to start
npm run validate-phase validate-start phase-1-foundation

# Start the phase (enforced gating)
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js start-phase phase-1-foundation

# Add some tasks
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js add-task phase-1-foundation db-audit "Database optimization audit"
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js add-task phase-1-foundation arch-review "Architecture review documentation"

# Check progress
npm run roadmap-status
```

### Completing Phase 1

```bash
# Mark tasks as complete
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js update-task phase-1-foundation db-audit completed "Completed database analysis"
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js update-task phase-1-foundation arch-review completed "Documented current architecture"

# Validate completion criteria
npm run validate-phase validate-completion phase-1-foundation

# Complete the phase (enforced validation)
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js complete-phase phase-1-foundation

# Phase 2 is now automatically unblocked and ready to start
```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Check roadmap health
npm run roadmap-health

# Check current status
npm run roadmap-status

# Work on tasks...

# Evening: Update progress and sync with GitHub
node scripts/roadmap/progress-tracker.js update-task <phase> <task> <status>
npm run roadmap-sync
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Roadmap Configuration (`config/roadmap-config.json`)

Defines:

- Phase structure and dependencies
- Validation criteria and tests
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Deliverable requirements

### Progress Data (`data/roadmap-progress.json`)

Stores:

- Current phase status
- Task completion state
- Progress percentages
- Blocker information
- Timestamps and metadata

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Enforce Consistency**: Phase gating prevents skipping steps
2. **Validate Completeness**: Automated checks ensure criteria are met
3. **Track Progress**: Detailed task and milestone tracking
4. **Generate Insights**: Meaningful reports and recommendations
5. **Stay Simple**: Lightweight tools that don't over-engineer
6. **Integrate Well**: Works with existing tools (ESLint, Jest, GitHub)

This system ensures that the 5-phase roadmap is executed systematically, with proper validation at each step, while maintaining simplicity and avoiding over-engineering.
