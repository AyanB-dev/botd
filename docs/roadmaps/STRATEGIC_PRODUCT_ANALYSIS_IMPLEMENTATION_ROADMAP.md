2. **Jump to Phase 2.1** - Focus on documenting your point system rules and edge cases first?

3. **Assess Phase 1.2** - Deep dive into the performance optimization files to see if they're being fully utilized?

4. **Create detailed branch structure** - Set up the Git workflow for this multi-phase approach?

**Which phase would be most valuable to start with based on your immediate needs?**

As your senior developer and product manager, I recommend starting with **Phase 1.1 (Documentation)** to ensure we understand exactly what functionality exists before making changes. This will prevent accidentally breaking features during enhancement.

What's your priority?
